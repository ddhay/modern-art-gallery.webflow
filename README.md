This is a project from Frontend Mentor.com. created using Webflow
I had two major unresolved issues:
a. Based on the active version presented in the Figma designs file, the Button/Arrow combination should switch colors on hover. While I could get
the Button to change from black to gold on hover, I was not able to style the arrow to switch from gold to black.
b. The second major issue is related to the letter "N" in the word MODERN as part of the title in the Hero Section. By using span I was able to 
achieve the color change in the letters in the word GALLERY that lap into the image, but I could not figure out how to select just part of the  letter "N" that laps over
into the lighter colored part of the image for changing color.

I researched CSS styling and could not find and methods to change color in just part of a letter.

My guess is that maybe this is something to be done first in a design app like Photoshop or Illustrator or maybe Figma.

Any suggestions on how to resolve these issues would be greatly appreciated.
